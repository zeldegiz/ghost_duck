# ghost_duck
Ghost Duck is symmetric block encryption algorithm . This algorithm consists of 4 steps :<br>
1 . Information expansion step -- plaintext length expand where it can be divided 1024 bit
2 . First encryption step -- in this step , plaintext information encrypt with xor operation and generated block keys
3 . Second encryption step -- generate s-box and all bytes convert another bytes
4 . Third encryption step -- block places are mixed
